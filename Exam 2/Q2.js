// Task: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum, difference, 
// and product using `prompt()` and `console.log()`.
// Rubric: 2 points for correct input handling, 3 points for correct calculations.

let a = 20, b = 40;

let sum = a+b;
console.log("Sum= " + sum);

let difference = a/b;
console.log("Difference= " + difference);

let Product = a*b;
console.log("Product= " + Product);
